Analysis {.storyboard}
=========================================

### Frame 1
```{The symphonic experiment corpus exists out of a myriad of symphonies, from a wide variety of composers. What is so interesting about this corpus, is that it spans over a period from the mid 18th century to the present day. This means that the corpus contains a certain chronological storyline, if we were to put all the symphonies side to side.
On the other hand, the corpus is not only about the historical composers and their lifes. This music has been played and recorded by actual musicians of the present day (however, assuming that the 'present day' is the recording era).
From this questions may arise like: from which country are these artists? what artists play only the popular composers? And can we see a trend in quality and diversity of recording?
Technical aspects aside, we may also look at the more musical aspects of this corpus: how have the symphonies evolved through time?
It is a common conception that contemporary symphonies have 'strayed away' from their original, classical, form. Is there actually a scientific proof to debunk or substantiate this?
To investigate, among others, the above mentioned questions, this corpus aims to serve as a representation of the symphonic timeline. Typical examples are the Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven symphonies, as they are written in the early classical period and are therefore strongly structered. However one must beware of possible prejudices when compiling such a corpus, because a strong preference for well-known composers may disturb the chronology and variety. That is why I also included some lesser known composers to keep things balanced and diverse. On the other hand, it is merely impossible to preserve a strict chronology in the corpus as musical history capricious; earlier eras such have less composers producing more output, in later eras such as the 19th century, symphonies became more popular and the number of symphonic composers steadily increased. Should we therefore add more romantic symphonies as they are more prominently present in musical history? 
As this example shows, picking the right symphonies is an arduous labour. Therefore I added a layer of 'randomness' to my selection process on the basis of a chronological list of composers.
The symphonic experiment corpus only exists out of full symphonies (so works of 3-4 movements or more). As the term 'classical' would refer to the classical period, I would rather define the overall genre as 'composed music'.}

### Frame 2
```{I added two graphs to visualise some aspects of the corpus. Firstly there is a graph that shows on one axis the year in which a title has been recorded, and on the y-axis the average popularity of all the tracks that year. As the graph shows, the average popularity of classical recordings remains relatively equal over time (between 10 and 20). However two minor dents can be seen in the early era (1960-'90) and a later era (1995-present). We can call this image "old legends vs. new generation" as it may show the slight division in popularity in the classical world between the old classical recordings (such as Bernstein etc.) and the modern high audio quality recordings. It also shows the increase of classical recordings from the nineties until the present day (which is a logical consequence of advancements in access to recording technology).
Furthermore, the graph shows the relatively modest popularity of the symphony as a musical style under spotify users. Compared to contemporary pop songs, we could conclude that symphonies may be reserved for a certain audience. However, all these claims have sociologic origins and need to be substantiated with literature before they can be taken for full truth.

The second graph shows the average acousticness of the symphonic recordings over time. The information we can get from this graph is that there have been virtually no large changes in this aspect. Which means recordings have over time, not relied more on electronic sounds than they used to. Some might claim this is an obvious result for a corpus existing only out of classical symphonies. Considering this claim to be true, there is always value in confirming certain prejudices before beginning an investigation.
The graph also shows the rigidness of the classical world, keeping the acousticness-value between 0.9 and 0.95 at all time.}
